Loop until valid difficulty is chosen (easy, medium or hard):
	Ask user for difficulty
	Use parameters (max_num and numofquestion)  to set difficulty.

Define create_question function
	Set two variables to randomize numbers according to chosen difficulty
	Make a set for the two operations ( + and -)
	Generate random operation/ question using functions of random
	Return randomized question

Define ask_question function
	Initialize score, question_number(i) and total time
	Create a question log to record response
	Loop randomized question until it reaches the final question
		Start timer
		Call create_question
		Ask user input as answer
		End timer when question is answered
		Add recorded time to elapsed_time
		
		

IF answer is correct
			Add 10 points minus time taken (1 point per second) to score
			Add 1 to question_number(i) to advance in questions
			Display time taken and points awarded

		ELSE answer is wrong
			Add 1 to i to advance in questions
			Add 0 to points
			Display “incorrect answer”
APPEND data(Question no., time taken, points awarded, correct or not) to question_log

ELSE response is invalid (not a number) 
	Add 1 to i to advance in questions
	Add 0 to points
Display final challenge question
	IF user answer is correct grant 20 points
ELSE grant 0 points and display incorrect respone or invalid response according to user input

Display final question breakdown using data from question_log
Show performance summary
